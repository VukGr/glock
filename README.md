# Glock

A minimalistic hourglass-style graphical clock application written in Racket.

## How it works

![Demo Image](https://i.imgur.com/xUFuyZk.png)

Rather than focusing on being able to tell the exact time at a glance I went for a design that graphically shows how much time is left in a single day.

In the left hand side every block signifies an hour.

In the right hand side every block signifies a minute, while the current minute block gradually fills up.

Colors, along with the sizes and offsets between the blocks, can be configured in the glock.json file.
